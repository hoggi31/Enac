Sure! Here's an example implementation of aircraft trajectories and an algorithm to detect collisions:

python
Copy code
import random

class Aircraft:
    def __init__(self, name, position, velocity):
        self.name = name
        self.position = position
        self.velocity = velocity

class CollisionDetection:
    def __init__(self, aircraft_list):
        self.aircraft_list = aircraft_list

    def detect_collisions(self):
        for i in range(len(self.aircraft_list)):
            for j in range(i+1, len(self.aircraft_list)):
                aircraft1 = self.aircraft_list[i]
                aircraft2 = self.aircraft_list[j]
                time_to_collision = self.time_to_collision(aircraft1, aircraft2)
                if time_to_collision is not None:
                    print("Collision detected between {} and {} in {:.2f} seconds".format(aircraft1.name, aircraft2.name, time_to_collision))

    def time_to_collision(self, aircraft1, aircraft2):
        position_difference = (aircraft1.position[0] - aircraft2.position[0], aircraft1.position[1] - aircraft2.position[1])
        velocity_difference = (aircraft1.velocity[0] - aircraft2.velocity[0], aircraft1.velocity[1] - aircraft2.velocity[1])
        if velocity_difference[0] == 0 and velocity_difference[1] == 0:
            # The aircraft are not moving relative to each other, so there can be no collision
            return None
        time_to_collision_x = -position_difference[0] / velocity_difference[0] if velocity_difference[0] != 0 else float('inf')
        time_to_collision_y = -position_difference[1] / velocity_difference[1] if velocity_difference[1] != 0 else float('inf')
        if time_to_collision_x >= 0 and time_to_collision_y >= 0 and abs(time_to_collision_x - time_to_collision_y) < 1e-6:
            # The aircraft will collide
            return time_to_collision_x
        else:
            # The aircraft will not collide
            return None

def generate_aircraft(num_aircraft, min_pos, max_pos, min_vel, max_vel):
    aircraft_list = []
    for i in range(num_aircraft):
        name = "Aircraft{}".format(i+1)
        position = (random.uniform(min_pos, max_pos), random.uniform(min_pos, max_pos))
        velocity = (random.uniform(min_vel, max_vel), random.uniform(min_vel, max_vel))
        aircraft_list.append(Aircraft(name, position, velocity))
    return aircraft_list

# Example usage
aircraft_list = generate_aircraft(5, -100, 100, -10, 10)
collision_detection = CollisionDetection(aircraft_list)
collision_detection.detect_collisions()
The Aircraft class represents an aircraft with a name, position, and velocity. The CollisionDetection class takes a list of Aircraft objects as input and implements the collision detection algorithm. The detect_collisions method loops through all pairs of aircraft and checks if they will collide using the time_to_collision method. If a collision is detected, it prints a message indicating which two aircraft will collide and how long it will take for them to collide.

The time_to_collision method calculates the time it will take for two aircraft to collide using their positions and velocities. If the time to collision is greater than or equal to 0 and the difference between the x and y times to collision is very small, then a collision will occur.

The generate_aircraft function is a helper function to randomly generate a list of Aircraft objects for testing.
